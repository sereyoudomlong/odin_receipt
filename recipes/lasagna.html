    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the
      type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with
      several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as
      meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
        beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the
        meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
        tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance
        the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
        parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and
        black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought</li>
      <li>
        Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna
        extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
        when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make this delicous lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2
        hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce.
        Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the
        mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
