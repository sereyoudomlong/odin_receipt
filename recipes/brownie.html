    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A brownie is a rich, square or rectangular chocolate dessert, with a
      texture that falls somewhere between a cake and a fudge. It's
      characterized by its dense, moist interior and a slightly crispy crust.
      The surface often has a glossy sheen, occasionally topped with a thin
      layer of melted chocolate or a sprinkle of powdered sugar for extra
      sweetness.

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan forced. Grease a 20cm (base measurement)
        square cake pan and line with baking paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of
        simmering water (don't let the bowl touch the water). Stir with a metal
        spoon until melted. Remove from heat. Quickly stir in egg, sugar, flour,
        cocoa powder, vanilla and salt until just combined. Pour into prepared
        pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre comes
        out with moist crumbs clinging. Set aside to cool completely.
